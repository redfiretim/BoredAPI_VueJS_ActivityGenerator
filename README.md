# BoredAPI_VueJS_ActivityGenerator
 Activity Generator web app in VueJS using Bored API


## What this application is about:
```
This Front-end web application lets you randomly generate an activity to do when you are bored.
It also lets you set parameters to find more specific types of activities.

It uses the Bored API to generate the data.
Axios to handle the requests and
VueJS with Vue Router for the Front-end code.

The initial design that was made before coding is also supplied to
show some of my process.
